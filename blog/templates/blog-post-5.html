                <p>
                    I know you have TWO MILLION NAIRA saved up but you don't know the car to buy, don't worry. You'll
                    benefit from reading this article. <br>
                    For one million Naira or even less, you can purchase a car, but they will be somewhat old models in
                    poor condition. I know the Toyota corolla aka the Uber corolla is on your mind or the go to/
                    suggestion you’ve been getting, yes, no doubt it is reliable and fits the price range but in my
                    opinion it is in high demand as you can see dozens per day and it is also overly priced. The 10 car
                    models listed below are ones you should consider if you're looking for more “modern” vehicles that
                    are reasonably affordable. Read to the end to find out which is the most popular and why.
                </p>
                <h3>10. HONDA ACCORD [2007-2012]</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="Img/2012-Honda-Accord-Evil-Spirit-Review-And-Price.jpg">
                            <img src="Img/2012-Honda-Accord-Evil-Spirit-Review-And-Price.jpg" alt="2012-Honda-Accord">

                    </li>
                </ul>
                First from the rear is the Honda Accord aka evil spirit. Even though this car is ten to fifteen
                years old, it is still one of the reliable vehicles that two million Naira can buy. The automobile
                still appears brand new, which is wonderful. If you're not told, you won't realize it has aged this
                long. <br>
                You can buy one that has been used in Nigeria for 2 million Naira. The price range for the Tokunbo
                variant is 2.5 million to 3.6 million Naira. To ensure that your car continues to serve you well,
                you must maintain it.

                </p>
                <h3>9. HYUNDAI SONATA [2004-2008]</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="Img/2008-Hyundai-Sonata.webp">
                            <img src="Img/2008-Hyundai-Sonata.webp" alt="2008-Hyundai-Sonata">
                        </a>
                        <figcaption>2008 Hyundai Sonata</figcaption>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Another nice car that can be purchased in Nigeria for two million Naira is the Hyundai Sonata from
                2004 to 2008. It still looks great and works well despite being an older version. The main problem
                is that you may not see it for sale, due to its scarcity in Nigeria. <br>
                Another issue is the high cost of replacement parts, given that the car isn't common in Nigeria.
                However, if you enjoy being noticed, this car should be your choice, with two million.
                </p>
                <h3>8. OPEL ZAFIRA [1999-2004]</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="img/opel_zafira.jpg">
                            <img src="img/opel_zafira.jpg" alt="opel_zafira">
                        </a>
                        <figcaption>opel zafira</figcaption>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The controversial child of this list would be the Opel zafira. With just 2 million naira you can get
                a good Nigerian used Opel Zafira. It’s a good looking car with ton of room for you and your
                friends/family as it seats 7 people, it has a spacious trunk with foldable seats. Even though this
                car is old, it is still one of the reliable vehicles that two million Naira can buy if you’re not
                all for the looks. Let’s not forget that this is a German machine, which makes it wonderful.
                </p>
                <h3>7. HONDA CIVIC [2005-2010]</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="img/Honda-Civic.webp">
                            <img src="img/Honda_Civic.webp" alt="Honda-Civic">
                        </a>
                        <figcaption>2007 Honda Civic</figcaption>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                You'll be shocked to find out that you can easily buy an eighth-generation Honda Civic (2005-2010)
                for two million Naira. At that cost, it's a great deal. It has a small steering wheel with good road
                traction and good fuel efficiency. <br> <br>
                If you buy this car, you'll enjoy it. But bear in mind that it's a Honda, you'll need to maintain it
                regularly and drive it properly.
                </p>
                <h3>6. ACURA TSX [2005-2007]</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="img/2005_Acura_TSX.jfif">
                            <img src="img/2005_Acura_TSX.jfif" alt="2005-Acura-TSX">
                        </a>
                        <figcaption>2005 Acura TSX</figcaption>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The TSX is Honda’s compact executive car sold through its Acura division, yes, you read that right,
                Acura is owned by Honda, so you should expect Honda reliability with the TSX but in a more luxury
                way. The TSX was built by Honda (Acura) to compete with BMW 3series and Mercedes C class. With just
                2 million Naira you can buy yourself a TSX.
                </p>
                <h3>5. BMW E90 3 SERIES</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="img/2006_BMW_E90_3Series.jpg">
                            <img src="img/2006_BMW_E90_3Series.jpg" alt="BMW-E90-3Series">
                        </a>
                        <figcaption>2006 BMW E90</figcaption>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The fifth car on this list is a little risky. The BMW 3 Series compact executive car line's fifth
                generation is identified by the model numbers E90 (saloon), E91 (estate, sold as "Touring"), E92
                (coupé), and E93 (convertible). The vehicle, which is frequently referred to as the E90 or E9x, was
                debuted in December 2004 and manufactured by BMW until October 2013. <br> <br>
                But on this list we’ll be talking about the E90, this car is very sweet based on performance and
                drives like a sports car, but bear in mind that BMW’s are problematic in Nigeria mostly because we
                don’t have experienced and efficient mechanics to work on them. With two million Naira, you can get
                yourself a beamer but I would advice that you do a thorough inspection of the BMW E90 that you’re
                buying.
                </p>
                <h3>4. LEXUS RX300</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="img/2003_lexus_rx300.jpg">

                        <figcaption>2003 lexus rx300</figcaption>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The Lexus RX 300 is the first model in the Lexus RX series and the only SUV on this list. This the
                only SUV you can get for around the two Million naira mark that would give you value for the money.
                If you purchase a clean, well-maintained, used RX 300, it won't let you down.
                </p>
                <h3>3. TOYOTA YARIS [2005-2010]</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="img/toyota-yaris-2008.jpg">
                            <img src="img/toyota-yaris-2008.jpg" alt="2008-toyota-yaris">
                        </a>
                        <figcaption>2008 Toyota Yaris</figcaption>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The third car on this list that you can get for around the two million Naira mark is the Toyota
                Yaris. The Yaris is the underdog of Toyota cars, if you’re looking for a car that flies under the
                radar but still gives you Toyota reliability and corolla vibes, then the Yaris this that car.
                </p>
                <h3>2. TOYOTA MATRIX [2002-2007]</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="img/toyota-matrix-2006.jpg">
                            <img src="img/toyota-matrix-2006.jpg" alt="2006-toyota-matrix">
                        </a>
                        <figcaption>2006 toyota matrix</figcaption>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The Toyota matrix is the only regular car that can give you so much utility, it is one of the cars I
                know, it may look compact but it packs a punch. If you’re out looking for a car that can give you
                space, reliability and sporty vibes all for two million naira, then the matrix is the right car.
                </p>
                <h3>1. LEXUS ES330</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="images">
                    <li>
                        <a href="img/2004_Lexus_ES330.jfif">
                            <img src="img/2004_Lexus_ES330.jfif" alt="2004-Lexus-ES330">
                        </a>
                        <figcaption>2004 Lexus ES330</figcaption>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The number 1 car on this list that you can get for two million Naira apart from the corolla is the
                Lexus ES330 (fourth gen). The Lexus brand is actually growing more popular than Benz and BMW As a
                result of customers learning that Lexus is a luxury car brand that is reliable and inexpensive
                despite not costing a lot of money. <br> <br>
                You can buy a neatly used Lexus ES330 in Nigeria for two million
                naira. It has a V6 Engine that is really fast and efficient and all the luxury features that a
                luxury car should have, like a leather inside and wood finishes. It is worth mentioning that the
                Lexus ES330 has a close resemblance to the Toyota Camry (2001–2006) aka Big Daddy that because the
                ES series is a revamped Camry.
                </p>
                <h3><strong style="color:red;">CONCLUSION</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Toyota Sienna, Toyota RAV4, Peugeot 307, and other vehicles are also available for two million
                    naira. However, this post proves that you can still buy high-quality cars in Nigeria with two
                    million naira.
